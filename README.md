## Tinytorrent a tiny automatic Torrent client

Work in progress, and anything TCP is a mess you will be connected to the whole world, network is not my strong suit :)


### NOTE: 
Can we learn classes so we can store data into classes instead of passing 293 stuff around? or other solution now it is functional classes programming or something? :P
